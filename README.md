## Project Background and Required Inputs
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a commonly used geophysical tool to measure subsurface properties. In this project, we use it to estimate snow density in conjunction with in-line probe depths. Code in this repository describes how to calculate density given the following parameters:
+ Two-Way-Travel times (TWT) in nanoseconds (travel of GPR wave from transmiter to receiver)
+ Snow Depth Probe data in meters
